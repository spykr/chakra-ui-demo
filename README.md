# Chakra UI Demo

## Getting Started

Welcome! First get the project started by running `yarn start`.

Here are the Chakra UI docs for reference: https://chakra-ui.com/docs/getting-started

## Instructions

Let's start playing around with Chakra UI and getting familiar with how it works.
Here are some instructions to get you started.

### Step 1. Customising our button component

Add a box shadow to our "Open modal" button and change the font
weight of all buttons to be bold by _only_ modifying our theme file.

Visit `src/theme.ts` to get started (you'll want to investigate `App.tsx` as well).

### Step 2. Creating an accessible modal

Create a modal (containing whatever you want) and make sure it's accessible.

Visit `src/MyModal.tsx` to get started.

### Step 3. Getting our modal opening and closing

Get our modal opening and closing as expected by
hooking up the modal and the "Open modal" button.

Visit `src/App.tsx` to get started.

### Step 4. Updating our logo component 

Currently our logo component has an image with a fixed height
and a heading with a fixed font size. We want to update the
component so that we can adjust the sizes of these elements
via the component props.

Visit `src/Logo.tsx` to get started.

### Bonus

For extra credit here are some things you could do:

- Have a look at the list of components in the Chakra docs and how they work
- Find a component or layout online and see if you can recreate it with Chakra
- Continue to customise your theme and home page
